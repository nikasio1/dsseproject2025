# dsseproject2025
This repository is the documentation of the work I did for a group project in the course: Data Science for Smart Environments in WUR.
In the Jupyter notebook, I explain how I achieved my learning goals while taking the reader through the methodology, details on implementation (code used with comments), the results, the conclusions from the results, the conclusions on the accomplishment of my goals.
IMPORTANT: To be able to run the code, unzip the "WorkingWaterDepth - unzip this" file.
